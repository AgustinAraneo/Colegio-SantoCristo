TITULO:  LITERATURE PROJECT: ANNE FRANK' S DIARY

DESCRIPCION: Our fifth- year students have read Anne Frank's diary, which inspired a research and the creation of oral presentations, debates and games.

The three fifth- year sections prepared interesting activities! We had a moment of reflection together.

Our students from 4th and  6th  form have created an escape room to play with third year students. They had a wonderful time!
